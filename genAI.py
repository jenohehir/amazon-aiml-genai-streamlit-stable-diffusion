    A user can work off of someone elseâ€™s generated image by starting from the same seed, prompt and parameters as them.
    
    You can make minor tweaks to an image by slightly changing the prompt or parameters without significantly altering the images overall composition. 
    
    Some seeds have been identified by Stable Diffusion user communities as having a higher probability of producing images with specific color palettes or compositions. Knowing what those seeds are and using them therefore gives you a higher probability of getting an output image containing a characteristic you want.
